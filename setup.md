title: Setup
---

<p>
  To participate in the workshop,
  you will need access to the software described below.
  In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
  You will need a PC with 64-bit CPU, since several packages we will be using are only available for 64-bit.
  To check this, open a bash shell, type 
</p>
  
  ~~~
  uname -m
  ~~~
  {: .language-bash}
  
 <p> 
  If your system is 64-bit the answer should be `x86_64`. 
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "{{site.swc_github}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.

## The Bash Shell

<div id="shell"> {% comment %} Start of 'shell' section. {% endcomment %}



  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.

      <h4 id="shell-macosx">macOS</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of macOS is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
        for an example on how to open the Terminal.
        You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

## Text Editor

<div id="editor"> {% comment %} Start of 'editor' section. {% endcomment %}


  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words. The default text editor on macOS and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive. If you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, hit
    the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, followed by <kbd>:</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>+<kbd>!</kbd> 
    (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark), then hitting <kbd>Return</kbd> to 
    return to the shell.

        nano is a basic editor and the default that instructors use in the workshop.
        It is installed along with Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others editors that you can use are
        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> or

        <strong>Be aware that you must
          add its installation directory to your system path.</strong>
        Please ask your instructor to help you do this.

## Git 
<div id="git"> 
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported
    web browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
      for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
	  <p>
          Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
          install (described above).
        </p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-macosx">macOS</h4>
	  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">Video Tutorial</a>
        <p>
          <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
          by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
          Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to
          right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click
          Open on the pop up window. 
          After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
          as Git is a command line program.
          <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
          most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.
        </p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-linux">Linux</h4>
        <p>
          If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
          install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
          <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
          <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.
